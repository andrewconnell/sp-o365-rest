Sample SharePoint Hosted App that demonstrates using the BreezeJS library with SharePoint 2013's REST API.

This is based off the work I did with [Ward Bell](http://www.twitter.com/wardbell) to get BreezeJS to work with SharePoint. Which you can read more about on my blog: [BreezeJS Makes Client-Side SharePoint 2013 REST Development a... BREEZE!](http://www.andrewconnell.com/blog/breezejs-makes-client-side-sharepoint-2013-rest-development-a-breeze) 

Work & improvements continue on the SharePoint data service adapter... check out my repository [andrewconnell/breeze.js.labs](http://www.github.com/andrewconnell/breeze.js.labs) which is a fork of the Breeze Labs repo where all SharePoint / Office 365 related work will go.

Applies To:
-----------
- SharePoint 2013 On-premises (versions: RTM to present)
- Office 365 SharePont Online (versions: RTM to present)
